**Jupyter Notebooks for Stream Flow Depletion (SFD) Analysis (Analytical Methods)**  
Developed for the California Department of Water Resources (Cal-DWR)  
Contact: behrooz.eteari@water.ca.gov  
**Modeling and Tools Support Section**  

The notebooks implement the following analytical models:  
1. Glover & Balmer (1954)  
2. Hunt (1999)  
3. Hantush (1965)  
4. Jenkins (1968)  
5. Singh (2003)  
6. Apportionment using GIS (GeoPandas), based on the closest stream distance  
7. Hunt (2003) â€“ still under development and requires adjustments for the Stehfest algorithm  

Additionally, a Glover-GIS Notebook was created for the Mark West Creek (HUC12) watershed, incorporating **average monthly pumping rates**. It uses **NHD datasets** and **water well data** from the report available at: [Coast Range Water Resources](https://www.coastrangewater.org/projects). The implementation relies on the GeoPandas library for GIS functionality.
